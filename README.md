# Backgroud - Problem Statement
For the credit card companies acquiring new customers is a lengthly and costly process. Thus, customer's attrition is one the utmost interest of financial firms. To reduce attrition rate, one immediate solution is to engage those clients who are projected to churn with enticing offers such as discounts, rebates or other perks.

# Tasks 
The goal of this project is to train a ML classifier that can help the credit card firm to single out who will churn in the future. Since churning can be considered a rare event and but it has significan financial repercussion, the model should focus on reducing recall rate. Predict non-churning customers as churned won't harm the business, but predicting churning customers as non-churning will do and should be avoided.
